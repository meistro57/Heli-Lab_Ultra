# Hemi-Lab Ultra

Hemi-Lab Ultra is a lightweight browser application for exploring altered states of consciousness. The project contains a single HTML file with an audio engine and optional static server.

## Quick Start
1. Open `Hemi-Lab_Ultra++.html` directly in a modern browser; or
2. Run `node server.js` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for a local server.

## Features
- **Binaural Beat Engine** – custom frequency entrainment with phase shifting
- **Focus Level Navigator** – Monroe Institute inspired presets
- **REBAL Energy Shield** – animated protection visualization
- **Breath Coach** – synchronized breathing prompts
- **Session Journal** – record mood and insights
- **Pattern Analysis** – discover optimal practice trends

## Usage
1. Select your desired focus level.
2. Adjust base/beat frequencies, phase and volume.
3. Click **Begin Session** to start audio and visuals.
4. Optionally enable the REBAL shield or breath coach.
5. After stopping, write down your experience in the journal.

The deeper states (Focus 15, 21, 23+) can produce profound results. Use quality headphones in a quiet space and document everything.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 – MVP
